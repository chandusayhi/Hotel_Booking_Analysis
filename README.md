# üí° Conclusions
* May-August happens to be the busiest months but so the hotels should target more customers and try to do more business during these times.
* The hotel business tends to make more profit during the rainy season.
* The hotels can keep experimenting with their packages, interiors and amenities as there are more new guests than the repeated guests.
* Majority of the hotels booked are city hotel. Definitely need to spend the most targeting fund on those hotel.
* Majority of the guests are from Western Europe. We should spend a significant amount of our budget on those area.
* The corporates mostly prefer Bed and Breakfast package, due to which the hotel can add more features to the package, also can profit from the customisation feature.
* Set Non-refundable Rates, Collect deposits, and implement more rigid cancellation policies.
* Encourage Direct bookings by offering special discounts.
* "August" Month has the Highest Number of Cancellations followed by "July" & "May".
